//! Short-lived OAuth `state` + PKCE verifier storage.
//!
//! `state` is the unguessable nonce we hand to the OAuth provider and
//! check on the callback to prove the response belongs to a redirect we
//! actually initiated. The PKCE `code_verifier` rides alongside it so we
//! can complete the token exchange without keeping the verifier in a
//! cookie (which would either need separate signing or be readable by
//! anything sharing the origin).
//!
//! Stored hashed (sha256, hex) — same pattern as `verification_tokens` —
//! so a DB leak doesn't hand an attacker live state values. TTL is short
//! (a few minutes) because the OAuth round-trip is synchronous;
//! `consume` performs the validate-then-delete in one statement to make
//! state values strictly single-use.
