//! Retention enforcement.
//!
//! Runs every 6 hours (and once on startup for fast dev feedback).
//!
//! **Account-lifecycle cleanup** — rows that are pure overhead once their
//! TTL has passed:
//! - Verification tokens older than 24 h (consumed or expired) — the email
//!   link is dead, the row is just bytes.
//! - Soft-deleted users older than 30 d — cascade-removes their devices,
//!   sessions, etc., reclaiming storage.
//! - Pending-verification accounts older than 7 d — the verify-email link
//!   expired at 24 h and the row only blocks the email from re-registering.
//!
//! **Operational-data TTLs** — high-volume tables are purged past a fixed
//! window so they don't grow without bound:
//! - `bandwidth_samples` (raw 1 s ticks)  — 30 d
//! - `server_samples`    (host metrics)   — 30 d
//! - `destination_ips`   (flow ingest)    — 30 d
//! - `audit_logs`        (audit trail)    — 30 d
//! - `failed_logins`     (auth failures)  — 30 d
//!
//! `bandwidth_aggregates` (hour/day rollups) is intentionally kept: it's
//! the long-term history the dashboards read and is tiny next to the raw
//! samples it's derived from.
//!
//! Operational-data windows default to the constants below but are
//! operator-tunable per table via `ZEROVPN_*_RETENTION_DAYS` env vars (read
//! once at startup — see `RetentionWindows::from_env`). Setting a var to `0`
//! disables that table's purge entirely (keep forever) — the opt-in
//! "unbounded" posture. Account-lifecycle TTLs (verification tokens,
//! soft-deleted users, abandoned signups) are policy, not storage tuning, so
//! they stay fixed.
//!
//! `bandwidth_samples` and `server_samples` are RANGE-partitioned on
//! `sampled_at`; a plain DELETE is correct but leaves empty partitions
//! behind — dropping whole expired partitions would be cheaper and is a
//! natural follow-up.
