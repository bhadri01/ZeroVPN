 * ZeroVPN service worker.
 *
 * Scope is intentionally minimal: it exists to make the app installable as a
 * PWA and to display + handle clicks on OS notifications. There is no Web Push
 * and no offline caching — notifications are shown while a session is live
 * (the page calls `registration.showNotification`), and a VPN dashboard needs
 * the live API anyway, so we deliberately don't intercept `fetch` (that keeps
 * Vite HMR and API calls untouched).
